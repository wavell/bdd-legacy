Behavior Driven Legacy Testing
===============================

**Why would you want to test a legacy system, such as a classic Asp application?**

One reason would be so that you could modify it safely.  A BDD approach to legacy maintenance also lets 
you rewrite a system piece by piece.  In many instances the *system is the spec*. This means you would do well
to document whatever you touch since you usually own that code afterwards.  BDD provides the best form of
documentation I know of in the form of *executable documentation*.  


**Requirements**
  
You must have [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [rubygems](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126)

**Installation**

```
gem install bdd-legacy
```

Then run the bdd-legacy command for your app.  This command will 
create a directory with a cucumber test suite with a number of 
utilities to get you started.

```
bdd-legacy mylegacyapp
```
**Specifiy Url**

Edit the *env.rb* file and point it to your application's domain name and url
Note: this can be a non-local url

``` ruby
#/features/support/env.rb
# Change this to the domain of your web server.  Don't add the full url
$workingAppHostLink='http://localhost'
# add the url of your login page
$workingAppLoginRoute='/welcome/logon.asp'
```

**Specify login steps**

If you have a log in page, edit your the **login_steps.rb** file and change the **fill in** function 
to be the *html* name/id of your username and password **fields** on your log in page

``` ruby
#/features/step_definitions/login_steps
Given /^I enter my username$/ do
    fill_in 'Username', :with => $workingAppUser
end

Given /^I enter my password$/ do
  fill_in 'Password', :with => $workingAppPW
end
```
**Username/Password**

Change the application's user id and password in your *env.rb* file.
These will get put into the fields previously mentioned

``` ruby
#/features/support/env.rb
$workingAppUser='myapplicationusername'
$workingAppPW='myapplicationpw'
```

**Change the rest of the defaults if needed**

``` ruby
# change to :test or :dev or :local
$currentOpt=:local

# the below server name will either be in the format of 'MYSERVERNAME' or 'MYSERVERNAME\DATABASEINSTANCE'
# depending on how your sql servr is set up
workingDBServerOpt={:dev => 'MYDEVDATABASESERVER',
                    :test => 'MYTESTDATABASESERVER',
                    :local => 'MYLOCALDATABASE'}
workingDBOpt={:dev => 'devdb',
           :test => 'tstdb',
           :local => 'devdb'}
# if you have a list of links after logging in with a single sign on account,
# you may also have a page of separate links for local/dev/test/prod etc           
workingEnvLinkOpt = {:local => 'Welcome',
                    :dev => 'Welcome',
                    :test => 'Welcome'}  
                    
$workingDBServer = workingDBServerOpt[$currentOpt]
$workingDB = workingDBOpt[$currentOpt]
$workingAppUser='myapplicationusername'
$workingAppPW='myapplicationpw'           
$workingDBUser='mydatabaseusername'
$workingDBPW='mydatabasepw'
```
