Behavior Driven Legacy Testing
===============================

**Why would you want to test a legacy system, such as a classic Asp application?**

One reason would be so that you could modify it safely.  A BDD approach to legacy maintenance also lets 
you rewrite a system piece by piece.  In many instances the *system is the spec*. This means you would do well
to document whatever you touch since you usually own that code afterwards.  BDD provides the best form of
documentation I know of in the form of *executable documentation*.  

*What is the benefit of [executable documentation?](http://www.literateprogramming.com/index.html)*

Well with executable documentation you could [cut and paste it](http://www.literateprogramming.com/quotes_ad.html) 
in an email and send it to a business expert.  This means that there would be less 
opportunity for something to get lost in the translation between your expert's statements 
and the implementation of those statments in code.

Take a look at this example:

``` ruby

Feature: Login
  In order to log into my app
  As my app's personnel
  I want to put in my user name and password
  
  Scenario: Log in
    Given I enter my username
    And I enter my password
    When I press Continue
    Then I should see the environment link 
    And I select the environment link
```

Even without any [further explanation](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin), 
(if you know english) you should be able to read and understand the above statements very,
very, easily.  This means your business experts can *at least be able to read* your code.
And yes, that is code.  Therefore, **a feature is executable documentation**


**Requirements**
  
You must have [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [rubygems](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126)

**Installation**

```
gem install bdd-legacy
```

Then run the bdd-legacy command for your app.  This command will 
create a directory with a cucumber test suite with a number of 
utilities to get you started.

```
bdd-legacy mylegacyapp
```
**Specifiy Url**

Edit the *env.rb* file and point it to your application's domain name and url
Note: this can be a non-local url

``` ruby
#/features/support/env.rb
# Change this to the domain of your web server.  Don't add the full url
$workingAppHostLink='http://localhost'
# add the url of your login page
$workingAppLoginRoute='/welcome/logon.asp'
```

**Specify login steps**

If you have a log in page, edit your the **login_steps.rb** file and change the **fill in** function 
to be the *html* name/id of your username and password **fields** on your log in page

``` ruby
#/features/step_definitions/login_steps.rb
Given /^I enter my username$/ do
    fill_in 'Username', :with => $workingAppUser
end

Given /^I enter my password$/ do
  fill_in 'Password', :with => $workingAppPW
end
```
**Username/Password**

Change the application's user id and password in your *env.rb* file.
These will get put into the fields previously mentioned

``` ruby
#/features/support/env.rb
$workingAppUser='myapplicationusername'
$workingAppPW='myapplicationpw'
```

**Change the rest of the defaults if needed**

``` ruby
# change to :test or :dev or :local
$currentOpt=:local

# the below server name will either be in the format of 'MYSERVERNAME' 
# or 'MYSERVERNAME\DATABASEINSTANCE' depending on how your sql servr is set up
workingDBServerOpt={:dev => 'MYDEVDATABASESERVER',
                    :test => 'MYTESTDATABASESERVER',
                    :local => 'MYLOCALDATABASE'}
workingDBOpt={:dev => 'devdb',
           :test => 'tstdb',
           :local => 'devdb'}
# if you have a list of links after logging in with a single sign on account,
# you may also have a page of separate links for local/dev/test/prod etc           
workingEnvLinkOpt = {:local => 'Welcome',
                    :dev => 'Welcome',
                    :test => 'Welcome'}  
                    
$workingDBServer = workingDBServerOpt[$currentOpt]
$workingDB = workingDBOpt[$currentOpt]
$workingAppUser='myapplicationusername'
$workingAppPW='myapplicationpw'           
$workingDBUser='mydatabaseusername'
$workingDBPW='mydatabasepw'
```
